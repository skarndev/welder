# Build, run & test

Read when: building, running the examples, or working on tests / .pyi stubs.

## Build & run
```bash
conan install . -pr:a conan/profiles/gcc16 --build=missing
cmake --preset welder-gcc16 -DWELDER_LUA_DIR="$(brew --prefix lua@5.4)"
cmake --build --preset welder-gcc16
```

**Version knobs (provider-neutral):** conan supplies the C++ backend headers
(sol2/pybind11/nanobind), but the *language runtimes* come from the system/user via
`find_package`, so a consumer can bring their own without conan. `WELDER_LUA_VERSION`
(default `5.4`) + `WELDER_LUA_DIR` (a Lua install prefix) pick the Lua the sol2
backend builds against and its tests run with; `WELDER_PYTHON_VERSION` (default
`3.14`) feeds `find_package(Python …)` + `uv sync --python`. Point `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`
/ these vars at your own installs to override the conan defaults.

Both example Python modules are then importable:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=build/welder-gcc16/examples/python_poc \
  python3 -c "import welder_poc as w; p=w.Point(); p.x=1.5; print(p.x)"
PYTHONPATH=build/welder-gcc16/examples/python_poc_headeronly \
  python3 -c "import welder_poc_ho as w; print(hasattr(w.Label(), 'cache'))"  # False
```

The Lua example (`examples/lua_poc` → `shapes_lua.so`) is a `require`-able module
(needs a Lua interpreter with `package.cpath` pointing at its dir):
```lua
package.cpath = "build/welder-gcc16/examples/lua_poc/?.so"
local s = require("shapes_lua")
local r = s.Rect(3.0, 4.0); print(r:area())   -- 12.0
```

## Lua backend build/test (sol2)
`welder::sol2` needs conan `with_sol2` (for the `sol2` C++ headers). **Lua itself is
NOT from conan** — `src/welder/backends/CMakeLists.txt` finds it with CMake's builtin
`FindLua`, pinned to `WELDER_LUA_DIR` so the user's install (not conan's transitive
`lua`, which shadows the search via `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`) provides the headers. A Lua
extension is created with `welder_sol2_add_module(<name> <sources>)`
(cmake/WelderSol2Module.cmake): bare `<name>.so`, host-symbol link model, and
**`CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES OFF`** (sol2's `<luaconf.h>` fails p1689 module scanning — a
header-unit macro-visibility issue with `LLONG_MAX`; so a Lua TU is header-only,
never `import welder;`). Gated by `WELDER_BUILD_SOL2` (default ON).

**Lua-version matching (important):** the module is built against `WELDER_LUA_DIR`'s
headers and loads its `lua_*` from the *host* interpreter; Lua has NO cross-minor ABI
compatibility — loading a 5.4-built module into a 5.5 interpreter **segfaults**. So
both must be the same minor. A configure-time guard **hard-errors** if the found Lua
minor ≠ `WELDER_LUA_VERSION`; set `-DWELDER_LUA_DIR="$(brew --prefix lua@5.4)"` (keg,
`brew install lua@5.4`). The runtime interpreter comes from that same prefix — the
busted wrapper (below) bakes it in — so there is no longer a separate interpreter
knob to keep in sync.

**Test framework — busted via luarocks (nothing vendored).** `tests/lua` installs
[busted](https://lunarmodules.github.io/busted/) at *configure time* into a
build-local luarocks tree (`--tree <build>/tests/lua/lua_modules --lua-version
${WELDER_LUA_VERSION} --lua-dir ${WELDER_LUA_DIR}`), the Lua analogue of the `uv
sync` step. Needs `luarocks` (found, or `-DWELDER_LUAROCKS_EXECUTABLE=`) **and**
`WELDER_LUA_DIR`; missing either only *skips* the `luatest.sol2` CTest (the module
still builds as a compile check), exactly like the uv gate. The specs are
`tests/lua/spec/*_spec.lua` (busted `describe`/`it` + luassert, mirroring the `.py`
files); `helper.lua` `require`s the built `welder_test_sol2.so` once. Run with
`--no-auto-insulate` — busted's default per-file insulation would unload and
re-`require` the C module, re-running `luaopen` and corrupting sol2's usertype
registration; one shared instance is the intended model (like the pytest conftest
fixture). `LUA_PATH`/`LUA_CPATH` (set by the CMakeLists) reach `helper.lua` and the
`.so`.

## `.pyi` stub generation
Via [pybind11-stubgen](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11-stubgen) (build-time):
`cmake/WelderPybind11Stubgen.cmake` → `welder_pybind11_generate_stubs(<target>
PYTHON <interp> …)`, a POST_BUILD step (`--exit-code`); gated by `WELDER_BUILD_STUBS`
(default ON). `PYTHON` must import the extension (ABI match) and have stubgen;
welder docstrings flow into the stubs. pybind11-stubgen is pinned to its GitHub
`main` branch (fixes not yet on PyPI; see `tests/pyproject.toml`
`[tool.uv.sources]`). Examples opt in via `-DWELDER_STUBGEN_PYTHON=<interp>`.

## LuaCATS stub generation (the Lua analogue of `.pyi`)
Lua has no runtime docstring slot, so the sol2 backend drops `doc`/`returns` at
load time; their home is a **generated LuaCATS (`---@meta`) definition file**,
emitted by the `welder::luacats` backend (`src/welder/backends/lua/luacats/backend.hpp`).
Unlike `.pyi` (pybind11-stubgen *imports* the built module), a Lua stub cannot be
scraped from a loaded sol2 usertype, so it is **reflection-emitted at build time**:
the stub backend is a real `welder::backend` that plugs the *same* generic driver
as sol2 but emits LuaCATS text instead of registering a live module — so member
selection, base flattening, policy/marks and the bindability gate are reused
verbatim; only the emission primitives differ. It is pure reflection + text —
**no sol2, no Lua runtime** — so `welder::luacats` is an unconditional INTERFACE
target over `welder::headers`. The one piece sol2 didn't need is the C++→LuaCATS
**type map** (`lua_type_string`): scalars → `integer`/`number`/`boolean`/`string`,
the STL wrappers welder recurses (`vector<T>`→`T[]`, `map<K,V>`→`table<K,V>`,
`optional<T>`→`T?`, smart pointers → the pointee), welded classes/enums → their
dotted Lua name, else `any`. A generator TU uses `WELDER_LUACATS_MAIN(<ns>)` (a
`main()` that writes the stub for namespace `^^ns` to its argv[1] path, else
stdout); `welder_luacats_generate_stub(<name> SOURCES … [OUTPUT …])`
(cmake/WelderLuaCATSStub.cmake) builds that generator and runs it into `<name>.lua`
as an ALL target. Overloaded methods/constructors/free functions render as one
documented `function` + `---@overload fun(…)` lines (the first overload with a doc is
the primary, keeping its `@param`/summary text; the others carry signature only, all
LuaCATS records). A **const** data member gets a `(read-only)` description note —
LuaCATS has no read-only field tag (an open lua-language-server request), so it is
documented, not enforced.

**Stub `---@operator` vs runtime metamethods:** `operator_luacats` (type_map.hpp)
only emits the operators lua-language-server actually models (`vm.OP_*_MAP`:
arithmetic/bitwise + `call`/`len`/`concat`/`unm`/`bnot`). **Comparison (`==`/`<`/
`<=`) and subscript (`[]`) are dropped** — they have no `---@operator` spelling, so
the sol2 runtime binds them (`__eq`/`__lt`/`__le`/`__index`) but the stub can't type
them; emitting `---@operator eq/lt/le/index` makes the language server reject the
stub with `unknown-operator`.

**LuaCATS stubcheck (the Lua analogue of `stubcheck.<variant>` mypy).** The
generated stub is validate-if-present linted by **lua-language-server**: the
`stubcheck.luacats` CTest runs `lua-language-server --check` over it and gates on its
exit code (0 = clean), gated on `find_program(lua-language-server)` — a missing
server only *skips* the lint (the byte-exact golden still gates), exactly like the
uv/luarocks gates. The stub is emitted into an isolated workspace dir
(`<bindir>/tests/luacats/stub/`) with a `.luarc.json` copied beside it: a `---@meta`
file *defines* but never *uses* its types, so the type/annotation diagnostics that
matter (`undefined-doc-name`/`-class`, `unknown-operator`) are forced on via
`neededFileStatus: Any!` — which only fires in a *workspace* check, so it must be a
directory check with the config co-located (a single-file `--check` ignores it).
This lint is what caught the invalid `---@operator eq/lt/le/index` emissions.

## Test-side type gates (mypy)
Three test-side mypy gates:
- `stubcheck` — mypy over each stub tree.
- `typingcases` — pytest-mypy-testing cases in `tests/python/test_types.mypy-testing`
  against the backend-neutral canonical name `welder_test` on `MYPYPATH`.
- `mypy.tests` — plain mypy over the `.py` specs (which are `Any` to mypy via the
  `ModuleType` fixture).

## Test layout & harness
Tests split by target language under `tests/`: the backend-neutral C++ case tree
(`common/cpp/`) and compile-only core checks (`core/`) live at the top; the Python
backends + their pytest specs under `python/`, the Lua backend + its busted specs
under `lua/`. The LuaCATS stub backend has its own top-level tree `tests/luacats/`
(compile + run + byte-exact golden + optional lint, needing only the compiler to
build — it depends on neither sol2 nor Lua): `welder_luacats_generate_stub` builds
`cpp/stub_gen.cpp` (a *dedicated doc-rich case*, since the shared cases are
behavior-focused and mostly carry no `doc` — same reason `doc.hpp` is its own Python
case) into `<bindir>/tests/luacats/stub/stubdemo.lua`, the `luacats.stub_golden`
CTest compares it to `stub.golden.lua`, and — when a `lua-language-server` is found —
`stubcheck.luacats` lints it (see the LuaCATS stubcheck note above). The **C++ case tree is shared across all three backends**
(`common/cpp/`, welded for `lang::py` **and** `lang::lua`), reached only through
three macros each `bindings.cpp` defines — `WELDER_TEST_BE` (backend namespace),
`WELDER_TEST_MODULE_T` (module handle type) and `WELDER_TEST_SUBMODULE` (the one
module-handle op the `register_*` helpers need: `def_submodule` for Python, a
nested-table helper for sol2). `WELDER_TEST_MULTIPLE_INHERITANCE` gates the diamond
case (pybind11 + sol2 — nanobind is single-inheritance, and the Python spec skips the
diamond when `Bottom` is absent). Only the genuinely backend-specific case files
(`trust.hpp` hand-registration, `caster.hpp` type_caster) are per-backend, under
`tests/python/{pybind11,nanobind}/cpp/`.

**Python trees** (`tests/python/`): uv + pytest + CTest; each extension is
dual-variant (module + header-only). The behavioral specs (`test_*.py` +
`conftest.py`) are backend-agnostic and select the module at runtime via
`WELDER_TEST_MODULE`, so the same specs run against pybind11 *and* nanobind. The uv
env is still prepared by the top `tests/CMakeLists.txt` (the doxyfilter tests also
use it for `lark`) but manages the pyproject that now lives in `python/`.

**Lua tree** (`tests/lua/`): **busted** (installed via luarocks, nothing vendored —
see the sol2 section above) is the Lua counterpart of uv+pytest. The shared
`common/cpp` groups (all but `doc.hpp`, whose `__doc__`/`attr` hooks are
Python-only) build into `welder_test_sol2.so`; per-group busted specs
(`spec/*_spec.lua`, mirroring the `.py` files) assert them in one `busted` run.
Where a case carries per-language marks, Lua sees the lua-resolved binding, which
differs from Python by design. `LUA_PATH`/`LUA_CPATH` (set by the CMakeLists) reach
`helper.lua` (which `require`s the `.so` once) and the built module. CTests
`luatest.sol2` and `negcompile.sol2_unwelded` (WILL_FAIL: an unwelded userdata
member is rejected by the gate). NB the Lua-version-matching gotcha above.

nanobind extensions are built with nanobind's own `nanobind_add_module` (it
compiles the nanobind runtime in) and stubbed with its own **bundled** stubgen
(`nanobind_add_stub`, `RECURSIVE` → a package tree per variant; no extra pip
package — `stubgen.py` is stdlib-only on Python ≥3.11, run via the build's
`Python_EXECUTABLE`, which loads the extension by dynamic lookup), then
`stubcheck.*` runs mypy over it. The `typingcases.*` type-level gate
(`test_types.mypy-testing`, run via pytest-mypy-testing) now runs against **both**
backends: each copies its module-form stub tree to the canonical name `welder_test`
on `MYPYPATH` and asserts the same revealed types — rename-safe because both stub
trees use only relative imports. (nanobind's copy hangs off its stub *target*'s
POST_BUILD, since its stubs are a separate custom target.) Key locations by feature:
- `tests/common/cpp/enums.hpp` + `tests/python/test_enums.py` — enums
- `tests/python/{pybind11,nanobind}/cpp/trust.hpp` + `tests/python/test_trust.py` — trust hatches
- `tests/python/{pybind11,nanobind}/cpp/caster.hpp` + `tests/python/test_caster.py` — self-contained type casters
- `tests/python/{pybind11,nanobind}/cpp/neg/` — bindability negative-compile (`negcompile.*` CTests, `WILL_FAIL`)
- `tests/core/template_annotations.cpp` — template↔annotation semantics (compile-only)
- `tests/common/cpp/doc.hpp` `Gadget`/`combine` + `tests/python/test_doc.py` — docstrings (multiline/dedent)
- `tests/doxyfilter/` — Doxygen filter goldens + e2e (run with the uv venv Python, pins `lark`)

Gotcha: uv rejects the Homebrew python for some operations — see the test-harness
memory note if you hit it.
